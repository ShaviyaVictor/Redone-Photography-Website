## Description
The project came up with a wedding photographic website where beautiful memories are refreshed with just a click of a button.   
The aim of this project was to create a photographic site whose objectives were to:    
- *Add to my site a list of my favorite photos*
- *Write a short biography of the website*
- *Make the page visually appealing as much as I can with the knowledge I have gained as per the time of the task*
- *Design the project before working on the project*
- *Attatch the design sketch that i come up with to the website for reviews*
- *Create a repository on Github for my project*
- *Familiarize myself with aking regular commits while working on the project*
- *Publish the site on gh-pages*

Below are the links to my published gh-pages as well as my Canva design sketch for the project:

## How to maneuver through the site
The site has three top headers that are supposed to lead site visitors and make their work easy by guiding them to the home page where bits of almost everything is covered and mentioned. Then there is the Portfolio button that is supposed to guide site visitors to a page where they can see and interact with some of the photos and connect with the lovely memories that are accompanied with the beautiful photos that tell the stories of the memorable days. The Contact button is also at the header so as to give the site users an easy job in case someone would want to contact or reach out to me. Here they can find my contacts and invite me to come and capture the moments for them.
